IMAD Assignment 2 . Here is my report conerning the android app that i have built, this android App built in android Studio it is a Pet game . The requirement is about to build an android app with 3 buttons ( Feed , Play, Clean) those buttons will be using to display the actions of each image of a pet once you click on the button; for example when you click on fee button , it will display by showing the pet is eating, if you click on play button , it will display by showing the image of the pet is playing, once you click on clean button , it will display by showing the image of the pet is bathing or it is cleaned. Now to built this android app , i used to work to MainActiviti.kt where i declared a variable called Start and i gave it an Id to make it be connected or linked , as the requirement is to have the first page where it will welcome once you clicked on buttton get started to allow people to start playing the pet game. I used also an Intent to connect or to link the first activity ( MainActivity) to the secondActivity.kt , from the secondActivity.kt , i started declare all variables that i used: Val Feedbutton , Val Playbutton , Val Cleanbutton , Val FeedTextview, Val PlayTextview , Val CleanTextview, Val imageview. All those variables  are declared and linked to theirs Id, for me to be able to build this android app , or to work confortable, writting this code , i must have first an UI (U ser Interface) where i draw or design what i need to do to make that app running. The User interface helped me to build first or to design my app and name the differents Id, after that i can be able to write my code for this game ( Pet game ). As i was writting this code , i have to put also pets images that why i declared also the varaible for the images. I used to increment all the  actions of pets through differents buttons ( Feed , Play, Clean) . The more i clicked on the button , the more it is incremented and show the satus of the pet. For each step as i was building the app, i must run the application , to verify the way its looks , until i finished then i checked the app to see if it is running , so i used GitHub to commit and push my new project by creating first the new repository in my GitHub account, through GitHub once my project is commited in ,it will be protected and saved, if i want to share my experience in building android app and coding , i can send to others only my GitHub link for that project, and they can be able to view or see my project. thanks
